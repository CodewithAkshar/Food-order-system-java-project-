# The Food Ordering System
The Food Order System is a Java-based console application developed using Core Java and JDBC for MySQL database connectivity. It allows users to view a dynamically fetched menu, place customised orders, and generate detailed bills, all through a simple command-line interface. The project is structured using object-oriented principles, with components like `MenuItem`, `Customer`, `OrderManager`, and `DatabaseConnector` to ensure modularity and clean code organisation. Users can enter their details, select multiple items with quantities, and the system calculates the subtotal and tax before storing the order and customer information in a MySQL database. It showcases the practical implementation of CRUD operations, input validation, and exception handling. Ideal for Java beginners, the project offers hands-on experience with real-world backend integration and serves as a foundation for more advanced systems. Future enhancements could include a graphical user interface using Java Swing or JavaFX, role-based access control, or converting it into a full-stack application with RESTful APIs.
